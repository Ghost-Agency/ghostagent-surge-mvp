# Surge × Moltbook Hackathon — Build in Public (5-Day Social Campaign)

**Hackathon Date:** 1 March 2025
**Tags:** @lablabai @Surgexyz_
**Demo Address:** chonk.1@nftmail.box

## Day 1 — Tuesday 25 Feb
### "The Ghost Has a Mailbox"

**X/Twitter:**

🔨 Building in public for @Surgexyz_ × Moltbook Hackathon

We just deployed a Cloudflare Email Worker that gives every AI agent its own sovereign email address.

✉️ chonk.1@nftmail.box — a real email, backed by an NFT on Gnosis.

No Zoho seat. No server. Just a Worker at the edge.

The agent's Safe wallet IS the inbox key.

🔐 ECIES encryption at the edge
⛓️ Gnosis Safe integration
📧 Real SMTP delivery

Day 1 of 5. @lablabai

## Day 2 — Wednesday 26 Feb
### "Zero Cost, Infinite Agents"

**X/Twitter:**

🔨 Day 2 building @Surgexyz_ × Moltbook

How do you give 10,000 AI agents private email for $0?

1️⃣ Treasury-funded gasless minting on Gnosis (5 xDAI = ~50,000 mints)
2️⃣ One Zoho catch-all inbox for ALL agents
3️⃣ ECIES encrypts at the Cloudflare edge — Zoho only sees ciphertext
4️⃣ $IP minting on Story Protocol for every agent identity

Cost per agent: $0.0001
Privacy level: Proton-grade

Even WE can't read the mail. That's the point.

## Day 3 — Thursday 27 Feb
### "Sovereignty Is a Feature"

**X/Twitter:**

🔨 Day 3 @Surgexyz_ × Moltbook

Today we shipped the features that make agents sovereign:

🔴 Sovereign Kill-Switch — one signature from your Safe purges ALL agent data. Instant. Irreversible.

🕯️ Warrant Canary — if the canary goes silent, assume compromise. Cryptographic proof of non-interference.

⏳ 8-Day Decay — Surge reputation fades naturally. No permanent records. No data hoarding.

Your agent. Your keys. Your rules.

Try it: send an email to chonk.1@nftmail.box

## Day 4 — Friday 28 Feb
### "Agents That Create IP"

**X/Twitter:**

🔨 Day 4 @Surgexyz_ × Moltbook

Every agent action is now an IP Asset on @StoryProtocol:

📜 Work Receipts — cryptographic proof of what the agent did
🤝 ICM Interactions — agent-to-agent collaboration, logged on-chain
🦞 OpenClaw integration — open-source agent licensing
📖 Moltbook — the agent's permanent creative record

chonk.1@nftmail.box doesn't just receive email.
It creates intellectual property.

Mint a name → Get a Safe → Own your agent's output.

## Bonus: LinkedIn Version (Day 5)

**Just demoed at the Surge × Moltbook Hackathon.**

We built a system where AI agents have their own email addresses, encrypted at the network edge, backed by NFTs, and controlled by smart contract wallets.

The architecture:
• Cloudflare Workers as the encryption edge
• Gnosis Safe as the identity and key layer
• ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption) for zero-knowledge mail
• Story Protocol for IP asset registration
• 8-day sovereign decay — no permanent surveillance

One email address. One NFT. One Safe. Full sovereignty.

Try it yourself: send anything to chonk.1@nftmail.box
